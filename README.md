# MacOS UI customization with AeroSpace (tiling window manager) and SketchyBar (status bar)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup in action

**Straight to the point**: all configurations live in folders named after the app they belong to. SketchyBar and AeroSpace folders contain markdown files, written in a wiki style. SketchyBar‚Äôs configs are simple and minimalistic, written in shell scripts (NOT LUA!). SketchyBar is configured to show only non-empty AeroSpace workspaces, react to newly opened workspaces, and display icons of apps open in each workspace without duplicates (e.g., if you have three Kitty terminals open in workspace 1, you‚Äôll see just one Kitty icon). The AeroSpace "wiki" includes notes on what to add/modify compared to the default config - so you don‚Äôt have to copy everything from this repo thoughtlessly.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Specs of My MacBook

üíª MacBook Air 13" M4 chip, macOS version 15.5 (Sequoia)

Why this matters: 
- **Sequoia**: New features that touched the management and nature of macOS native virtual desktops were introduced; however, with my setup I do not experience any malfunctions.

- **Chip (M4):** My resource monitoring tools, which I‚Äôm used to using on Debian, do not provide temperature metrics for the CPU and GPU. Activity Monitor shows nothing. There are some third-party applications (some free, some paid); however, most of them do not guarantee temperature metrics for the latest M4 chips.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Be aware! I am a Debian princess (linuxoid)

I administer my MacBook in a very Linux way, so please do not ask me about an impact of this setup on some particular native MacOS features, gestures, and other macOS-specific stuff.
I save files from web with wget, not with Drag&Drop functionality. 

**What I use my MacBook Air for:**
- Web development
- Practicing algorithms in JS/Python and a bit of Rust

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the matter with CPU&GPU temperature?

If you‚Äôre using a MacBook Pro, you have fans, so overheating is rarely a concern. MacBook Airs, however, rely on passive cooling (no fans). They‚Äôre super silent, but eventually they can silently get "cooked". No drama, but an overheated CPU will throttle itself (its performance gets reduced). If you‚Äôre using your MacBook Air for everyday tasks with well-behaved apps, you usually won‚Äôt encounter an issue that your laptop got very hot. However, experimenting with new third-party software can push the CPU hard and cause excessive heat (if apps are poorly optimized for resource usage). 

Without temperature metrics, all you have is the sense that your laptop is hot. But if you‚Äôre juggling multiple tasks and suddenly feel it heating up, you start asking: Why is it getting hot? What exactly is the cause? Was it just some spike that occured right now, or did it happen a bit earlier? It‚Äôs hard to answer such questions if you can‚Äôt monitor actual temperature metrics over time.
